# React with typesript and Redux-toolkit

### _This small project is only to practice how we can integrate RTK with react and typescript_

### As a todo application where we can mark as finish a task and show all, complete and active task deppending on its status

I decided using these technologies because Redux-toolkit is a powerfull state management tool for react to pass data through components with.

## Tech

- React -17
- Typescript 4
- @reduxjs/toolkit 1.6.1
