# React with typesript and Redux-toolkit

### _This small project is only to practice how we can integrate RTK with react and typescript_

### As a todo application where we can mark as finish a task and show all, complete and active task deppending on its status

I decided using these technologies necause Redux-toolkit is a powerfull tool for react to pass data through components with its state management.

## Tech

- React -17
- Typescript 4
- @reduxjs/toolkit 1.6.1
